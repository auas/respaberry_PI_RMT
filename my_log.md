###it took me a lot of time to build this working environment for I never use virtural machine before, and it took me a long time to get used to it. it seems that I have fallen behind at the beginning. but anyway I can get started now~

#step2
## lit a LED:
###follow the [instructor]([http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/step01-bare-metal-programming-in-cpt1/](http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/step01-bare-metal-programming-in-cpt1/))  to lit a LED. reading guide book in English seems difficult for me, but after piles of hard work, I thought I got what the author mean: in resp_pi, set a specific register can control the pin it refers to.  without boot or OS, the machine will start to load and execute the file named "kernel.img". by gcc the code and name it properly, I'll be able to set the LED blinks to my will.
